Need to define a fuction that accepts two numbers a, b
######plan
To get a and b in the output statemt ,we use interpolation and assign it the comparison statement i.e ${a} is smaller than ${b}
If (a - b) is negative, the result of the modulus operator will be 0 so a is smaller than b. 
If (a - b) is zero, the result of the modulus operator will be 1 so a is equal to b. 
If (a - b) is positive, the result of the modulus operator will be 2 so a is bigger than b.
